# kickstarter-analysis
## 1. Overview of Project

### 1.1. Purpose
The main purpose of this analysis is to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. In other words which campains have been sucessfull, failed, and or canceled according the launch dates and their goals.

## 2. Analysis and Challenges

### 2.1. Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
After analyzing the Outcomes in based of Launch Dates for the Play category we can conclude that the months with the highest numbers of successful campaigns were May and June and July also those months we have more campaigns launched in overall, as well as the months with the highest number of Failed campaigns were November, December.
The number of cancelled campaigns were almost constant trough the year.

### 2.2.  Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

On Regards the Outcomes we can conclude that the campaigns with goals less than 1000 and between 1000 to 4999 have the most successfull percentage as well as the campaigns were the goal was between 35000 to 50000 and more. Percentage of Cancel campaigns remain constant.

### 2.3. Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The only challenge I found was related to the syntaxis of the "If" conditional in Excel.


## 3. Results
** 3.1 What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The conclusion I have drawn regarding the Outcomes base on Launch Dates is that is more convenient launch a campaign in May and/or June, because since that is summer time, and the people is more willing to attend and support the campaigns.However is not good idea start campaigns in the months of November and December, looks like the people is very busy with the end of year holidays, like Thanksgiving and Christmas, and they don't pay so much attention to the campaigns specially on December.

** 3.2. What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Regarding Outcomes based on Goals, we can conclude that goals with less amount of money are easy accomplished, because in our data those have the highest percentage of sucess. Also we can infer that the campaigns with goals in range of 35000 to 50000 and more have a good percentage of success, it looks like since the goal is higher, then we need more effort and 
resources to archive those high goals.
  

** 3.3. What are some limitations of this dataset?
	
One of the limitation in this data set could be some missing information like Total Investment, that could give us a complete idea about the profit of the campaign.

** 3.4 What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We can create also Subcategory Outcomes by Goal and Launch date as well as the graphs and the Backers count by category/subcategory.
